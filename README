Celestia catalog files for the Firefly 'Verse as described in The Verse in
Numbers/the official maps etc.

Because I'm a nerd like that, yeah.

To use, symlink (or your system equivalent) the checkout directory into your
Celestia extras directory, eg.

sudo ln -s /home/kevinr/src/firefly-verse-celestia \
  /usr/share/celestia/extras/firefly-verse-celestia

Restart Celestia if necessary.

Once Celestia is running, search for 'White Sun' and Go.  You're on your way!
