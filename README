Celestia catalog files for the Firefly 'Verse as described in The Verse in
Numbers/the official maps etc.

All values taken or derived from The Verse in Numbers 2.0:
http://pics.fireflyprops.net/TVIN-2.0.pdf

As of May 28, 2014, contains all planets, moons, and Cortex stations with
orbital data given in TVIN 2.0 except Lear, as noted in the source.

Because I'm a nerd like that, yeah.

To use on Linux or Mac OS X, symlink the checkout directory into your Celestia
extras directory, eg.

sudo ln -s /home/kevinr/src/firefly-verse-celestia \
  /usr/share/celestia/extras/firefly-verse-celestia

Restart Celestia if necessary.

Once Celestia is running, search for 'White Sun' and Go.  You're on your way!

All questions, comments, corrections, emendations, etc to
kevinr@free-dissociation.com.

In particular if you have meshes for the various stations (Niska's skyplex, the
Sky Mall, etc.), and you would be willing to grant me permission to
redistribute them here, I would love to have access to them.
